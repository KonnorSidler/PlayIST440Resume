    <font size="5">
    Our goal is to create a useful resource to better equipped university students with their job ambitions. As current Penn State University students, we are very familiar with the struggles students go through to find jobs as they are nearing graduation.
By viewing resumes of those who have already been hired by the studentâ€™s target company, they will be able to get a sense of what skills it is important for them to know to be hired by the companies they are interested in working for.
