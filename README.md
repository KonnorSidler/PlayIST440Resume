# PSU Resume Center

A web application to host and retrieve sample resumes. Ideally, this will be a useful tool for post-graduates in their hunt for a job.

The PSU Resume Center will be comprised of three parts. First will be a search function to retrieve resumes mapped to certain companies. Next, those retrieved files will be viewable within the web application. Finally, a GUI will be provided on an administration page to upload resumes to the database for later retrieval.
